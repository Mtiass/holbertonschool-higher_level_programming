# Introduction to Python Programming

*Python* is a versatile and powerful language that‚Äôs **easy** to learn and use.\
Python is widely used in various fields, from web development to data science.

- Installation instructions on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/).

### Using the Python Interpreter

The Python interpreter allows to execute Python code interactively.\
Open your terminal or command prompt and type **python** to start the interpreter.\
You can write and run Python code directly in the interpreter.

## Printing Text and Variables

Use the **print()** function to display text or the values of variables. \
For example:
```
print("Hello, Python!")
name = "Alice"
print("Welcome, {}!".format(name))
```

## Working with Strings
*Strings* are sequences of characters.\
You can manipulate them using various methods.\
For instance:
```
message = "Python is fun!"
print(message.upper())  # Convert to uppercase
print(len(message))     # Get the length
```

## Indexing and Slicing
Python allows you to access individual characters in a string using *indexing*.\
For example:
```
word = "Python"
print(word[0])    # Prints 'P'
print(word[1:4])  # Prints 'yth'
```

### Python Coding Style
Checking Your Code with *Pycodestyle*.
Install pycodestyle using ```pip install pycodestyle```\
Run it on your Python files to ensure they follow the recommended style guidelines.
