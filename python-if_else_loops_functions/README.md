# Python Basics: if/else, loops, functions

### Conditional Statements: If, If-Else

Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code.\
Use **if**, **if-else**, and **elif** to control the flow based on conditions.

### Variable Assignment

Assign values to variables using **=**.

### Loops: While and For

Use *while* and *for* loops to repeat code.\
**while** loops execute as long as a condition is true.\
**for** loops iterate over a sequence (like *lists* or *strings*).

### Break and Continue Statements

*break* exits a loop prematurely.\
*continue* skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

### Else Clauses in Loops

The **else** block in loops executes when the loop completes\
normally (without encountering a *break*).

### The pass Statement

Use **pass** as a placeholder when you need a statement grammatically\
but donâ€™t want it to do anything.

### Using the range Function
*range(start, stop, step)* generates a sequence of numbers.\
It is useful for loops.

### Arithmetic Operators
Use **+**, **-**, **\***, **/**, and other operators for calculations.

### Understanding Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code. Define them using **def**.\
Functions can omit a return statement. They implicitly return None.

### Variable Scope

Variables have different scopes (local vs. global).
Understand where a variable is accessible.
